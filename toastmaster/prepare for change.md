This Tuesday, I attended an interview, the position looks very idyllic and pays very well. I got the JD last Thursday and applied for it and on Saturday, the recruiter told me the employee would like to have an interview with me, then I had a busy Sunday, busy Monday, so you can guess what happen now, it did not say that I failed the interview, I just felled   I did very bad.
I could not stop thinking, I did a lot of interviews half a year ago, I should be ready for another interview, 

why do I feel so bad this time.

I think I am in a comfort zone trap. I am satisfied with my current job, I can learn new techniques from my job, the workload is ok, I have verya good relationship with my colleges, so I did not prepare well even I have 3 days to prepare.

Here I am not to encourage you to achieve more in life, I am not to motivate you to get out of the comfortable zone and jump into a growth zone. 

today I just want to advise all of you to be prepared for changes because preparation are so important.

why? the benefits are very obviously
Minimize risks and disruption
Optimize clarity, efficiency, and consistency
Gain a competitive edge
Stay within budget

are those tips very like business tips? yes, I copied them from a website. 
but let us think the situations which are very common in now a days and what should we prepare.
1, prepare for job change: keep touch with some recruitor, Occasionally check related job post, take some interviews even you are not looking for a change

2, Prepare for the rising price of produce 
we know some produce price rise a lot in some important days, or in some season, like Chrismas, thanks given, or the sport stuff in summer, so when you find some good produce in discount, buy them earlier for special event.

3, prepare for school close
when scholl close, how to spend the time with the kids, when and where to take vacation, which activity we can take part in. like me, I bought a football table recently when I saw 
some one sold their used football table in great price, now I can play it with my son in door every day.

4, prepare for covid
 which madicine should prepare, how to isolate you from you family and how to protect your family.

 those things are what I thought in one day, I think if you take you time your will have more ideas.

Walmart has an AD, Save better , live better.
now I would to say:
Prepare better, live better

back to you, toastmaster.
