Protect yourself and your family
Follow toastmaster,  happy new year, I am so glad to see everyone here and safe. 
Currently, the number of covid araised sharply, from hundreds to thousands then more than 10 thousand.
for my family, we canceled the Christmas plan, the new year plan and stayed at home for the whole holiday to stay the sale.
But we continued to get notice someone who tested positive around us.

How about the best way to protect me and my family.

I could not stop thinking about it.

Here are some tips on what I do.

firstly, when you going out.
bring a mask and wear it all the time when you enter any indoor public place.
wear a glove when you touch anything in stores.
wash your hands whenever you find sanitizer 

secondly, before you start to drive
make sure there is a sanitizer in your vehicle, before touching anything in the car, wash your hands.
and open the window if you park your vehicle in the garage. and keep a small seam when you park it when you go out.

then, when you back home
 from a supermarket or a mall,  take a walk for about 5-10 minutes outside, 
I am not so sure it is useful, but Ialways do that, I think something sting to my clothes or hair will go away after a walk
after that,  change your clothes, leave your coat in your garage,
when you enter your home, wash your hands, face, any place expose to the public immediately is very necessary,
and it is better to take a bath

those 3 steps are very important, but the most important thing I would say is: you should have a strong body, you should enhance your resistance 
 so I would like to suggest you do more exercise.
make a daily exercise plan and a weekly plan to make your body stronger.
like me, I run twice or three times a week, about 10 km each time, and also I will play outdoor soccer when the weather is allowed.
keep doing exersice will make you stronger.

Making your body stronger is not only with more exercise, but you should also eat well.
Make a schedule or a daily meal plan. A schedule is more predictable for you and for everyone in your household.
I do not want to give you the food name, but you should keep in mind, 
take enough vitamins and those vitamins should include vitamin a- e, you should also take enough protein. they will help the immune system

5, Improve your mood and lower stress
Stress symptoms may be affecting your health, even though you might not realize it. but stress may actually be the cause of any illness.
Keeping a good mood will also help you away from the sick.
bad mood is lead to sick too, Having an online chat or an outdoor activity will help you have a good mood.


the last one is: sleep well.
sleep is the best way to refresh your body. Sleep is an essential function that allows your body and mind to recharge, leaving you refreshed and alert when you wake up. 
Healthy sleep also helps the body remain healthy and stave off diseases.

interested in a topic.

Thank you for sharing this informative speech. The topic is very timely and useful. You have prepared for it very well and organized your points well. I noticed that your speaking is becoming more confident, with fewer pauses. That is very good. Keep practicing to further reduce hesitation and filler words in your speech ("uh...").  I also suggest checking and adjusting your camera position so that you appear more toward the centre of the screen. You were slightly to the right from my perspective. Overall, you did well and showed improvement. Keep working and you will build more skills. You speak well when you are interested in a topic.
