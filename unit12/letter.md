Board vote of confidence confirms Mr. Jay Cooper's CEO position

 

We are releasing this public statement to refute the recent slanderous rumors in the music industry about Fast Records Inc. It has been falsely reported in the press that Fast Records has recently experienced a slump in sales, and it was suggested that our CEO, Mr. Jay Cooper, was about to step down from the position before the board forcibly removed him.

 

This absurd claim is entirely fabricated, and we believe it originated in the press as a result of the poor performance of a number of our competitors. Later today, our sales team will be releasing our quarterly sales figures, which in fact show a healthy upswing in sales due in large part to an increase in download royalties. Moreover, a board vote of confidence resulted in a 10-0 confirmation of Mr. Jay Cooper's position as CEO.

 

These extremely irresponsible reports will be the focus of an investigation by Fast Records' legal team. It is injurious to shareholders to publish reports when the facts have not been thoroughly checked. It is for the sake of our shareholders that our lawyers will be taking swift action to seek compensation and an apology from those responsible for these absurd claims.
