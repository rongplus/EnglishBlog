Indira: I’m not sure how quickly I will be  able to build the skills needed. There’s so much to learn.
Sylvia: You will have  at least five years before Ken is going to leave  us. So there’s no need to rush yourself.
Sylvia: Now, the first part, the first-level leadership, will last  two years. Then we will organize  a quality assurance training course with one of our certification bodies.
Regarding the machinery and the production process: first of all, you will be work-shadowing  Ken and will learn from him.
Indira: Sure, that’s something I am really looking  forward to.
Sylvia: In addition, we can think about you joining a work-study program with the SIT. .... Not now, but maybe in two years? By then, you will have gained  a better overview of what Ken’s job involves.gi
